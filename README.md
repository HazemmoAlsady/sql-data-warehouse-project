# sql-data-warehouse-project
## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a modern data warehouse using SQL Server, covering key areas such as:

Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process

Data Modeling (Star and Snowflake Schema)

Analytics & Reporting

The implementation follows industry best practices and leverages SQL Server's capabilities for efficient data processing and storage.

## Technologies Used

- ** SQL Server 2019/2022**

- ** SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for ETL **

- **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) for OLAP**

**SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for Visualization**

**Power BI for Business Intelligence**

**Python (Optional) for Data Processing**

## Project Requirements

-** SQL Server 2019/2022 installed with SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS.**

-** AdventureWorks or a similar sample database for testing.**

-** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for database administration.**

-** Power BI Desktop for dashboard creation.**-

## Features

- ** ETL Workflow: Extract data from transactional databases, transform it into a structured format, and load it into the warehouse.

- ** Data Modeling: Implement star and snowflake schemas for optimized query performance.

- ** Analytics & Reporting: Generate insightful reports and dashboards using Power BI and SSRS.

- ** Performance Optimization: Indexing, partitioning, and query optimization techniques.

## Setup Instructions

- ** Install SQL Server 2019/2022 with SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS.

- ** Restore Sample Database (if using AdventureWorks or a custom dataset).

- ** Execute ETL Scripts from /etl folder in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

- ** Deploy Data Models from /data-modeling folder.

- ** Load Reports & Dashboards into SSRS and Power BI.

## Usage

- ** Run ETL jobs to keep the data warehouse up-to-date.

- ** Use Power BI or SSRS for data visualization and reporting.

- ** Optimize queries using indexes and partitioning techniques.
